# Recipe App
Try it out [here](https://zw16recipeapp.herokuapp.com/)

## Introduction
The Recipe App is a great resource to help get new recipe ideas, share recipes, and add recipes that will satisfy not only your belly but get you out of the dark ages and have these recipes at the tip of your finger. No more searching through old cookbooks or rummaging around trying to find grandmas super secret recipe thats written on an index card. Only to find it with the ink faded and you having to guess if grandma was using 1/2 cup of apple slices or 1/2 a cup of apple spice. By all means go ahead and take that step and make the call, just add the recipe to the Recipe App so you don't have to wonder again next time.

## User Story
Most of us have at one point and time had a recipe for something that was scribbled down on whatever was handy and within arms reach at that time. We wanted somewhere safe to input that recipe to avoid wasting time searching for it, decyphering it, and trying to replicate it for ourselves.
